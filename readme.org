#+TITLE: Arduino ePaper Clock Calendar Sketches

Collection of four sketches for creating an e-paper (e-ink) clock or calendar with an Arduino (Uno or Nano) and a Waveshares 2.9" e-paper screen.

* Wiring

All the sketches assume the Arduino is wired as follows:

   | SQW         |                    | D2, for interrupt alarm, set with wakeUpPin()             |
   |-------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | Screen      |                    |                                                           |

   | RST         | White              | D9                                                        |
   | CS          | Orange             | D10                                                       |
   | DIN         | Blue               | D11                                                       |

   | Arduino GND |                    | D4 (Optional, connect to add 1 hour for daylight savings) |

* GxEPD2_with_two_fonts

Requires:
- [[https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2][GxEPD2]]
Test the GxEPD2 library for displaying graphics on the e-paper screen. Specifically showing how to use two different fonts on the same display. 

See article [[https://www.henryleach.com/2022/03/arduino-e-paper-screen/][Arduino E-paper Screen]] for more details.

* sleep_wake_with_rtc

Requires:
- [[https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC][DS3232RTC]]
- [[https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power][LowPower]]

Use a DS3231 Real Time Clock module's alarm function, and the low-power library to put the Arduino to sleep, and then wake it again. 

See article [[https://www.henryleach.com/2022/03/arduino-real-time-clock/][Arduino & Real-Time Clock]] for more details.

* epaper_clock

Requires:
- [[https://github.com/JChristensen/DS3232RTC][DS3232RTC]]
- [[https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power][LowPower]]
- [[https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2][GxEPD2]]
- [[https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX][U8g2 for Adafruit GFX]]

Displays the time, and date, on the e-paper screen, updating every minute. Puts the Arduino to sleep in between.

Use the SetSerial example sketch from the DS3232RTC Library (File -> Examples -> DS3232RTC -> SetSerial).

If you need to adjust between winter and summer time (plus 1 hour) set the time to winter time, then connect GND to pin D4, this will add 1 hour to the displayed time.

* epaper_weekday_calendar - In Progress

Shows the day of the week in large letters across the top, and the date below in a smaller font. Updates daily at midnight, sleeps the Arduino in between.
