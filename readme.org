#+TITLE: Arduino ePaper Clock Calendar Sketches

Collection of four sketchs for creating an epaper clock or calendar with an Arduino (Uno or Nano) and a Waveshares 2.9" epaper screen.

* GxEPD2_with_two_fonts

Test the GxEPD2 library for displying graphics on the epaper screen. Specifically showing how to use two different fonts on the same display. See article [Arduino E-paper Screen](https://www.henryleach.com/2022/03/arduino-e-paper-screen/) for more details.

* sleep_wake_with_rtc

Use a DS3231 Real Time Clock module's alarm function, and the low-power library to put the Arduino to sleep, and then wake it again. See article [Arduino & Real-Time Clock](https://www.henryleach.com/2022/03/arduino-real-time-clock/) for more details.

* epaper_clock

Displays the time, and date, on the epaper screen, updating every minute. Puts the Arduino to sleep in between

* epaper_weekday_calendar

Shows the day of the week in large letters across the top, and the date below in a smaller font. Updates daily at midnight, sleeps the Arduino in between. 

* Wiring

All the above sketches assume the Arduino is wired as follows:
